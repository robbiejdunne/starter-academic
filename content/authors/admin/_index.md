I am a writer and data analyst from Ireland currently living in Madrid, Spain. After studying journalism, I moved to Madrid and worked for one of the biggest sports newspapers n the country while learning to speak Spanish. I wrote a book about the football club, Rayo Vallecano, and it is in Spain where my love for data analysis began.
